# C-Journey
This is a repository of all the code I will use to learn C programming. 
Most of exercises I will solve here come from C How to Program With Case Studies in Applications and Systems Programming, 9th edition, Global Edition by Deitel & Deitel.






// To compile these exercises on Linux using gcc, we have to use the following command:
// gcc -std=c18 name-of-program -o name-of-program-without-file-extension
// to run the program: ./name-of-program-without-file-extension
